// Mermaid JS does not seem to allow you to have different colours for the edge and node text.
// In order to remedy this, we are directly overriding the CSS so we can make it look the way
// we want.

.edgeLabel {
  // Make the color of the text within the links black
  color: black !important;
}

.nodeLabel {
  // Make the color of the text within the main nodes white
  color: white !important;
}
